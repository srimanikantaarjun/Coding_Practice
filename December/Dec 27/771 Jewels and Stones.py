https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have.
Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
